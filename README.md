Asteroids Game
Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple 2D space shooter game inspired by the classic Asteroids game. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and tries to survive by dodging and shooting asteroids. The main focus is on implementing core mechanics such as spaceship movement, rotation, asteroid spawning, and collision detection.

The key objectives of this project are:

- Implement basic game mechanics: movement, rotation, shooting, and asteroid collision.
- Create a dynamic system where asteroids continuously appear in the game.
- Implement collision detection between the player's bullets and asteroids.
- Include a simple user interface that displays the player's current state.



Result


The final result of the project is a fully functional 2D space shooter game with the following features:

Player Ship: The player controls a spaceship that can rotate, move, and shoot bullets.
Asteroid Field: Asteroids continuously spawn and drift through space in random directions.
Collision Detection: When the player's bullets collide with asteroids, the asteroids are destroyed. The bullets also disappear after colliding.


Basic Mechanics:

The player can rotate the ship left or right.
The player can move forward or backward.
The player can shoot bullets in the direction the ship is facing.
Game Loop: The game runs continuously with asteroids randomly generated at regular intervals, and the player must avoid or destroy them.


Features:

Player controls: Rotate (left/right), move forward/backward, shoot bullets.
Asteroids: Spawning and movement of asteroids in random directions.
Bullet Mechanics: Bullets are fired in the direction of the playerâ€™s rotation.
Collision Mechanics: Asteroids are destroyed when they are hit by bullets.


Technologies Used:

Python: Main programming language.
Pygame: Library used for game development, handling graphics, user input, and game logic.
